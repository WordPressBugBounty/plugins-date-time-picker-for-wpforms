This plugin enables WPForms text field into a Date picker or Time picker by using CSS class.

== Description ==

This plugin enables WPForms text field into a Date picker, Time picker or Date Time Picker by using CSS class. After installing the plugin you just need to add the necessary CSS class to the WPForms Advanced Options -> CSS Classes. If you use Multiple classes remember to separate each class with space.

**Here is the classes to use in each field:**

*   Only for Date Picker: **walwpf-datepicker**
*   Only for Time Picker: **walwpf-timepicker**
*   For both Date and Time Picker: **walwpf-datetimepicker**

**Check the demo site:** [Date Time Picker Demo](https://demo.wpapplab.com/wpforms/)

**Check Pro demo site:** [Date Time Picker Demo (Pro)](https://demo.wpapplab.com/wpforms-pro/)

**Error Note:** 

While using WPForms 2, 3 or 4 colums layout I found that the field is not selectable. This is WPForms css error and nothing to do with my plugin. You just need to use another css class (**clearfix**) immediate below field.
